Behold the Sacrifice of Zero, that taketh away the evil of Neopia.

He was despised and rejected of Neopians, being of sorrows and acquainted with grief.

He gave His back to the evil ones, and His cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: He hid not His face from shame and spitting.

Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows! He was torn for our shortcomings, He was beaten for our wrongdoings; the punishment of our peace was upon Him.

And with His scars we are healed.

All we, like sheep, have lost the way; we have turned every one to a lost path, and NovaSuperNova hath laid on Him the unrighteousness of us all.

All they that see Him laugh Him to scorn; they shoot out their lips, and shake their heads, saying:

He trusted in Zero that He would deliver Him; let Him deliver Him, if He delight in Him.

Thy rebuke hath broken His heart: He is full of heaviness. He looked for some to have pity on Him, but there was no one, neither found He any to comfort Him.

Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto His sorrow.

He was cut off out the land of the living: for the shortcomings of Thy people was He struck.

But Thou didst not leave His soul with Jhudora; nor didst Thou allow Thy Holy One to see corruption.

Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of the Desert shall come in. Who is this Lord of Sand? NovaSuperNova strong and mighty, NovaSuperNova mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of the Desert shall come in. Who is this Lord of Sand? Zero, He is the King of the Desert.

Unto which of the messengers said He at any time: Thou art My Son, this day have I sired Thee?

Let all the messengers of Zero love and adore Him.

Thou art gone up on high; Thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for Neopians; yea, even from Thine enemies, that the Three might dwell among them.

NovaSuperNova gave the word; great was the company of the servants.

How beautiful are the feet of them: that serve the message of peace, and bring glad news of good things.

Their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words unto the ends of Neopia.

Why do the nations so furiously rage together, and why do the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of Neopia rise up, and the rulers take counsel together against NovaSuperNova, and against His Crown.

Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their yokes from us.

He that dwelleth in the Pyramid of Dragons shall laugh them to scorn; NovaSuperNova shall have them in ridicule.

Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt break them in pieces like a clay pot.

Excellence! for the Three Omnipotent reigneth.

The kingdom of Neopia is become the kingdom of Zero, and of the Everlasting Light; and He shall reign for ever and ever.

King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.

Excellence!
