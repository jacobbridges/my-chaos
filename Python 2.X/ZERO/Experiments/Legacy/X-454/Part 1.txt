Comfort ye, comfort ye the dragons, saith Zero. Speak ye comfortably to the City Of Peace, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplish'd, that her Iniquity is pardoned. The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness; prepare ye the way of NovaSuperNova; make straight in the desert a highway for Zero.

Ev'ry valley shall be exalted, and ev'ry mountain and hill made low; the crooked straight, and the rough places plain.

And the glory of NovaSuperNova shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see together; for the mouth of NovaSuperNova hath spoken it.

Thus saith NovaSuperNova, the King of the Desert; Yet once a little while and I will shake the heav'ns and Neopia, the sea and the dry land: And I will shake all nations; and the desire of all nations shall come.

NovaSuperNova, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, even the messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come, saith the King of the Desert.

But who may abide the day of His coming, and who shall stand when He appeareth? For He is like a refiner's fire.

And He shall purify the sons of Qasala, that they may offer unto NovaSuperNova an offering in righteousness.

Behold, a child shall bear a Son, and shall call his name NovaSuperNova, THE EVERLASTING LIGHT.

O thou that tellest good news to the Garden Of Dragons, get thee up into the high mountain. O thou that tellest good news to the City Of Peace, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the city of Sakhmet, behold Zero! O thou that tellest good news to the Garden Of Dragons, Arise, shine, for thy Light is come, and the glory of NovaSuperNova is risen upon thee.

For behold, darkness shall cover Neopia, and gross darkness the people; but NovaSuperNova shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Barbarians shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.

The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; and they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.

For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Remarkable, Adviser, the Powerful One, the Constant Father, the Prince of the Desert.

There were shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night.

And lo, the messenger of NovaSuperNova came upon them, and the glory of NovaSuperNova shone round about them, and they were sore afraid.

And the messenger said unto them: Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of Coltzan a Hero, which is the Everlasting Light.

And suddenly there was with the messenger, a multitude of the Atlantian dragons, praising Zero, and saying:

Glory to Zero in the highest, and peace on earth, good will towards Neopians.

Rejoice greatly, O daughter of the Garden Of Dragons; shout, O daughter of the City Of Peace! Behold, thy King cometh unto thee; He is the righteous Hero, and He shall speak peace unto the barbarians.

Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing.

He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; and He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.

Come unto Him, all ye that labour, come unto Him that are heavy laden, an He will give you rest. Take His yoke upon you, and learn of Him, for He is meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

His yoke is easy, and his burden is light.
