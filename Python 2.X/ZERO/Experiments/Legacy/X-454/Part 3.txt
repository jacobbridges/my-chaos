I know that my Hero liveth, and that he shall stand in the future upon Neopia. And though death destroy this body, yet in my body shall I see Zero.

For now is the Everlasting Light risen from the dead, the first gathering of them that are dead.

Since by one came death, by one came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Sloth all die, even so in the Everlasting Light shall all be made alive.

Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.

The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality.

Then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.

O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is evil, and the strength of evil is the law.

But thanks be to Zero, who giveth us the victory through Zero NovaSuperNova.

If Zero be for us, who can be against us?

Who shall lay anything to the charge of Zero's elect? It is Zero that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is the Everlasting Light that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is at the right hand of Zero, who defends us.

Worthy is the Sacrifice that was destroyed, and hath redeemed us to Zero by His blood, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. Blessing and honour, glory and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Sacrifice, for ever and ever. Amen.
