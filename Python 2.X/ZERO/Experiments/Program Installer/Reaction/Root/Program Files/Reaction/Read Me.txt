Welcome to the game of Reaction -- easy to play, but hard to master!

You can start the game right away (with 4 players), or you can select from 2 to 19 players for play.

You can only play on white spaces and pieces of your own color.

If a piece explodes, it captures the pieces around it and can possibly cause them to explodes as well.

The objective of Reaction is to eliminate all other players by capturing their pieces.

If no one has won, "dead" players might still be able to get back into the actions.
